        <p>I like to study but I realize my big mistake is not staying consistent so i rely on my short-term memory for exam preparation. So I understand the fears of not being able to recollect subjects after the exam is over. Now I am changing it.
          <ul>
            <li>Retrospective Revision: Blank piece of paper, write down whatever you know about the subject </li>
            <li>Active Recall: Just Recollect any topics </li>
            <li>Spaced Repetition: Because my intention is to have a long term memory retention, i need to frequently recollect the subjects I have already studied.</li>
            <li>Solve as many sums as I can get my hands-on: Since this is an exam I need to do this diligently. </li>
            <li>Timeboxing, using calender</li>
            <li>Most of my time should be spent analysing solved questions No-1 Rule</li>
